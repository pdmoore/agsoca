      <h2>The Leader Within: move from Resistance to YES with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louria-lindauer/" target="_blank">Louria Lindauer</a><br /></h2>
      <br />
      <p>
         Who are we as Agile Leaders and how do we show up in the world, with our teams, and within organizations?
      </p>
      <p>
          Have you wondered why some people or teams respond to more than others?
          Why sometimes the same techniques work from some people/teams and not others?  Are you asking - "Why are they so resistant?"
      </p>
      <p>
          This all has to do with the Agile Leader that lives within all of us.
          We will discover our Agile Leadership Stance and with which culture environments we are most comfortable and how to elevate our agile effectiveness.
          Come lets have fun and discover together more agile super powers!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Your Presenter:</strong></p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
          Louria has lived every role in an agile organization from software engineer to organizational agility enterprise coaching and strategy.
          In her own company, <a href="https://www.successagility.net/" target="_blank">SuccessAgility</a>, she has worked with hundreds of organizations and Agilists.

      </p>
      <p>
          Louria fell in love with coaching when she took her first agile coaching course which lead her to co-active coaching and becoming a Co-Active Leadership Faculty.
