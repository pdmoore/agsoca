    <p>CREATING A TEAM – Sometimes All You Need Is A Little Glue</p>
    <p>
        Have you ever been in your daily or weekly team meeting and thought to yourself, “Does this guy next to me really give a rip about what we are try to accomplish as a team?” Or, “If I threw in a few ‘meows’ in the middle of my discussion, would anyone even notice? Would they laugh?” Or, the worst one, “Why can’t everyone on this team just get along?”
    </p>
    <p>
        I think we all have asked these questions from time-to-time — some of the times are with new teams and some of the times we are working with teams that have been together for a long time and they have just become numb to the daily grind. In all cases these behaviors result in poor motivation, infighting, slow innovation, friction and tension, and in general, just not good places that we want to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this session we will discover some of the causes of these problems and the impact on the individuals, the team, and the organization. Then we’ll explore how questions can help bring teams together and change the vibe of any group situation. You’ll walk away with a great technique to evolve your team from tolerate to collaborate.
    </p>

        <a href="http://www.groupgluebook.com/#about-the-author">Jeff Cook</a> has been leading teams for nearly two decades with companies such as John Deere, FTD, and Constellation Software. In his various leadership roles Jeff has used questions to create a binding element within his teams, which has built more authentic relationships. As author of the book, <a href="http://www.groupgluebook.com/GroupGlue">Group Glue</a>, Jeff brings stories and experiences of how these “question experiences” can evolve your team from “tolerate” to “collaborate”.
