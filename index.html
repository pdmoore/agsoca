<h1><a name="NextMeeting" id="NextMeeting"></a>AgileSoCal Monthly Meeting - Wednesday, January 25th 6:00 PM</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Outputs versus Outcomes
<em>with</em> <strong>Ben Rodilitz</strong></h2>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 25th (Note this is the 4th Wednesday!)<br />
  Networking and food, 6:00 PM.<br />
  Activities start, 6:30 PM.<br />
</p>
<p align="center">***** Always free, but <strong>YOU MUST RSVP to <a href="mailto:agilesocal@gmail.com?subject=RSVP Jan 25th meeting">agilesocal@gmail.com</a></strong> *****</p>
<p>
  Too often, we focus on the Outputs of our work – the “what” – and not on the desired Outcomes – the “why”, the impact we want.<br />
</p>
      <p>

      <ol>In our January meeting we will:</ol>
        <li>  work together to recognize the differences between the two.</li>
        <li>  relate those differences to our day-to-day activities by identifying the Outputs from our various Scrum/Kanban ceremonies and examining them through the lens of sought-after Outcomes.</li>
        <li>  share ideas on how better to line up what we are doing with the Outcomes we aim for.</li>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
  A desired Outcome of this evening is to help us “break out of the box” of providing by-the-book outputs and increase team effectiveness using an Outcome-focused approach.<br />
</p>
<p>
      <em>BONUS:</em> within the first 5 minutes, you will learn why your smartphone is able to provide you with turn-by-turn directions and the small-but-crucial part your presenter had in making this happen.  And why this has anything to do with anything.

</p>
<p><strong>Your Presenter:</strong></p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-rodilitz-9946a1">Ben Rodilitz</a>, CSP and PMP, just completed his 3+ year stint as Scrum Master for Vermont-based Dealer.Com's Manhattan Beach software development teams as well as Agile Coach for its parent, Cox Automotive.
</p>
<p>
After receiving his Bachelors and Masters of Engineering from UCLA, Ben dabbled in aerospace for 18 years. The first three were at TRW doing Independent Verification and Validation of government software projects. The next 15 years involved working on communication and navigation products at Magnavox Research Labs culminating with work on very early commercial GPS products.
</p>
<p>
After a decade of software development and project management consulting, Ben went back to his GPS roots with a five-year stint at chip manufacturer SiRF. This was followed by another period of consulting, focusing on start-up organizations targeting the smartphone explosion and its need for location-based applications. After finally realizing that "start-up" came from the Latin root meaning "we can't pay you", Ben began his engagement with Dealer.Com in August, 2013.
