      <h1><a name="NextMeeting" id="NextMeeting"></a>AgileSoCal Monthly Meeting - Wednesday, August 15th 6:00 PM</h1>
<p></p>
      <h2>Agile Conversations - Introduction to Nonviolent Communication <em>with</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorraineaguilar/">Lorraine Aguilar</a></h2>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, August 15th<br />
  Networking and food, 6:00 PM.<br />
  Activities start, 6:30 PM.<br />
</p>
      <p>
          The Agile Manifesto has two core values that require great communication skills. Being a truly effective communicator may not be a skill you've consciously worked on. At this month's session Lorraine Aguilar will introduce <a href="https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/">Non-Violent Communication</a> (NVC) and how to help you and your teams amplify their interactions and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
          NVC is an empathy-based set of principles and practices that promote psychological safety, collaboration, innovation, inclusion and connection across differences. It's used around the world in companies including Microsoft, Google, Nissan and Samsung to promote human-centered work environments. It is also used internationally in education, parenting, mediation, social activism and other environments where people influence positive change.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Your Presenter:</strong></p>
      <p>
          <a href="https://about.me/lorraineaguilar">Lorraine Aguilar</a> is passionate about empowering people to collaborate, innovate and influence others for the greater good. She has trained and coached senior leadership teams at Nissan, Merck, the United Nations and other organizations whose success depends on effective collaboration.  She has spoken at numerous Agile events, including the Global Scrum Gathering and Agile Open conferences.
      </p>
      <p>
          Lorraine speaks regularly to business leaders in the United States, China and Korea on how to influence and engage people using Nonviolent Communication (NVC), an empathy-based communications framework that promotes collaboration and innovation. A certified trainer in NVC and former engineer and corporate manager, Lorraine is internationally recognized for her development of NVC-based programs and tools that create a more empathic, collaborative and creative workplace.  In addition to her consulting practice, she teaches NVC-based communications as an instructor at UC Irvine and presenter for the University of Southern California (USC) Executive Masters of Leadership Program.
