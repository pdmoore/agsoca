      <h1><a name="NextMeeting" id="NextMeeting"></a>AgileSoCal Meeting - Wednesday, June 16th, 6:00 PM Pacific</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Culture and Agile Transformation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcdanziger/" target="_blank">Marc Danziger</a> and <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/peteaturner/" target="_blank">Pete Turner</a><br /></h2>
      <br />
      <p>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcdanziger/" target="_blank">Marc Danziger</a> writes crazy things about Agile at <a href="https://wickedproblems.substack.com/" target="_blank">wickedproblems.substack.com</a>.
          This month's topic will come out of one of these pieces in which he asked how we understand and change culture as a part of agile change.
      </p>
      <p>
          Marc sees the Agile community as splitting between 'procedural' and 'behavioral' subgroups, each trying to find ways of driving change deeper into
          organizations. The barrier we face is organizational culture, and in his experience, we don't yet have reproducible, scalable methods to define and
          change organizational culture.
      </p>
      <p>
          Marc's oldest son served in Afghanistan for 2-1/2 years, and for 1-1/2 of those years he did work in trying to bridge to local culture with SOCOM.
          This led to Marc's reading and learning a lot about what is being done in the military around these things - some of which is not working and some of which appears to work.
      </p>
      <p>
          Marc Danziger met Pete Turner and they've spent a lot of time discussing how to see, understand, and shape culture - and they thought it would be
          good to broaden this discussion out and see what others think of it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Your Presenters:</strong></p>
      <p>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcdanziger/" target="_blank">Marc Danziger</a> uses and teaches Agile in software and business delivery.
          Marc has used (and according to some abused) agile development practices since the late 90's, making him not quite old-school - but close.
      </p>
      <p>
          Right now Marc is focused on enterprise agile transformations, at the delivery, operations, and executive layers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
         <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/peteaturner/" target="_blank">Pete A Turner</a> is a former Army combat spy with over 1000 missions in
         conflict zones in a variety of countries, including Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and Afghanistan. His daily missions took him off-camp and out to
         find the people, information, and secrets that enabled commanders to win. Ultimately Pete succeeded because he learned to earn the
         trust and work within the culture of the most dangerous and evil people in the region. This trust and cultural capacity allowed Pete
         unique access to the “Ground Truth” illustrating the realities that exist below the tactical level.
      </p>
      <p>
         Today Pete uses his “Ground Truth” focused collection techniques on the <a href="https://www.breakitdownshow.com/" target="_blank">Break It Down Show</a> (BIDS).
         BIDS illustrates life through the experiences of fascinating people. With over 1000 episodes, his show is a leader in the veteran creative
         space. He is also the creator of the Prison Chronicles, an 8-part limited series from the Break It Down Show. For more on Pete, or to inquire
         about his services, email to <a href="mailto:pete@breakitdowshow.com">pete@breakitdowshow.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         Pete has authored and published several peer-reviewed articles focused on aspects of modern conflict. He is a recognized expert
         on modern combat, culture, and international relations.
