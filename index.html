      <p></p>
      <h2>Scaling Lean Agile Metrics Across Your Software Company with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidihelfand/" target="_blank">Heidi Helfand</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timdoherty/" target="_blank">Tim Doherty</a><br /></h2>
      <p>
          When will it be done? We all want to be able to answer that question with confidence. Software development is hard. Estimating software development accurately is darn near impossible. We have a critical need to become more predictable to help our companies succeed. As seasoned software developers, we've read the books on lean. We've hired the consultants. And this year, we believe that we've found the holy grail to make our predictability problems disappear. Sounds great, right?
      </p>
      <p>
          Reality check. The challenge is that when you are  trying to enact change, and there are people involved, it's not so easy as find the best solution and install it in your teams. You can't just force things on people. You need to take a different approach.
      </p>
      <p>
          Questions come up like this: How do you get the people to buy into your change and own it? How do you invite people in as participants in the change and not try to shove the latest agile techniques down their throats? In this talk, Heidi Helfand and Tim Doherty will share their best tactics for success when introducing new changes in your organization so that you can learn from our mistakes and be inspired to drive change in your own organization.
