      <h2>Scrum vs Kanban - How Does An Agile Team Choose? with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/agilebrett">Brett Palmer</a></h2>

          When a product development team decides to use an agile approach to implement their projects they must first decide on what agile framework will suit each team best. Although many agile frameworks have been used by different organizations to implement product development projects, Scrum and Kanban seem to be the most popular.
      </p>
      <p>
          Brett Palmer will use real-life examples from his own extensive agile experience to discuss the differences between Scrum and Kanban to help you and your agile team decide which is better suited to act as a guide for how the team collaborates, learns, and performs the work.
